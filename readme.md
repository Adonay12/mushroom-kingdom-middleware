# Mushroom Kingdom Middleware

Let's build a simple server that pipes the client's request through multiple functions.

## Goals

We will talk about:

1. Building routes

1. Working with parameters and query parameters

1. Application-level and route-level middleware

1. Third-party middleware vs custom middleware

1. Error-handling middleware

## Setup

1. Fork and clone this repository

1. Set-up this project as an npm project

1. Install `express`, `body-parser`, `morgan`, and `nodemon`

1. Set-up a simple server in a new file called `app.js`

1. Write a "dev" script that runs `app.js` with `nodemon`
